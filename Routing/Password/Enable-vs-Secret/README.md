# Enable Password vs Enable Secret Lab

This lab demonstrates:

- Setting hostnames (R1, R2)
- Configuring `enable password` (cisco) and `enable secret` (ccna)
- Testing which password is used for privileged exec mode
- Viewing the running configuration to check encryption
- Using `service password-encryption` to encrypt plain-text passwords
- Saving and reloading to confirm configuration persistence
