# Serial Connectivity with CDP and DCE/DTE

This lab demonstrates:

1. Using CDP to discover connected interfaces.
2. Identifying DCE vs DTE ends of a serial link.
3. Setting a clock rate (64 Kb/s) on the DCE side.
4. Assigning IP addresses:
   - R1: 192.168.0.1/24
   - R2: 192.168.0.2/24
5. Testing connectivity with ping between routers.
